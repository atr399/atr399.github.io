# Reverse Linked List (LeetCode 206) â€“ Adapted to "Reverse Traceroute Path in Linked List Representation"

## Problem Description (Theory & Real-World Usage):
Given the head of a singly linked list representing a traceroute path (each node is a hop with IP/value), reverse it and return the new head. Theory: Linked lists use nodes with val/next pointersâ€”efficient for insertions/deletions (O(1) vs. O(n) in arrays). Iterative reversal flips pointers in O(n) time/O(1) space; recursive uses call stack for O(n) space but elegant for nesting. Constraints (n<=1000) suit recursion; in production, iteration avoids stack overflows. Real-world: Traceroute paths are linear; reversing simulates return paths in asymmetric routing (e.g., detect loops/mismatches). In SRE at Tesla/xAI, reverse paths for AI traffic analysis (e.g., optimize ML data flows); at Google/Meta, automate SDN path reprogramming
### ðŸ§© Example Input/Output

```python
Input: head = [ "10.0.0.1" â†’ "192.168.1.1" â†’ "8.8.8.8" ] (hops)
Output: [ "8.8.8.8" â†’ "192.168.1.1" â†’ "10.0.0.1" ]
```

Solution Code:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=None, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverse_path_iterative(head):
    prev, curr = None, head
    
    while curr:
        next_temp = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = next_temp
    return prev
```

### ðŸ§© Example usage

```python
hop1 = ListNode("10.0.0.1")
hop2 = ListNode("192.168.1.1")
hop3 = ListNode("8.8.8.8")
hop1.next = hop2
hop2.next = hop3
reversed_head = reverse_path_iterative(hop1)
# Print reversed: 8.8.8.8 -> 192.168.1.1 -> 10.0.0.1
```
Solution Code (Recursive):

```python
def reverse_path_recursive(head):
    if not head:
        return None
    new_head = head
    if head.next:
        new_head = reverse_path_recursive(head.next)
        head.next.next = head
        head.next = None
    return new_head
```

### ðŸ§© Example usage (same nodes as above)

```python
reversed_head = reverse_path_recursive(hop1)

```
